If the user selects the ADD option, then the user will be prompted to choose to ADD an department, a role or an employee to MYSQL database. Once the user selects his/her option and complets adding the department, the role or the employee, the user will be prompted back to the intial prompt of choosing to ADD or VIEW. The user can select ADD again, if the user wants to add a department, role or an employee.

These are the four options the user will have to choose from in the prompt.
